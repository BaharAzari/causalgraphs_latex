Drawing graphical models for causal inference using LaTeX

This repository contains LaTeX code for creating the most common types of graphical models used for teaching and thinking about causal inference. These models include:

1. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
2. Single-world intervention graphs (SWIGs)
3. Probability trees for inverse probability weighting
4. Decision trees for Markov models.
